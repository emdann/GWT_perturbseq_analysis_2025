MuData object containing genome-wide differential expression results computed independently for each individual sgRNA guide (rather than aggregating across guides). Two modalities, named by the alphanumeric rank of the guide ID within each (perturbed gene, culture condition) pair:

- `guide_1` — DE results from the first guide of each (perturbed gene, culture condition) pair (sgRNA IDs sorted alphanumerically; lowest = `guide_1`).  
- `guide_2` — DE results from the second guide. Targets tested with only a single passing guide are present in `guide_1` and missing from `guide_2`.

Each modality is an AnnData with the same `.obs`, `.var`, and `.layers` schema as `GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad` (see "Differential Expression Results" above for column descriptions). The observation key is `{target_contrast}_{culture_condition}`.


## Donor-pair differential expression results

Filename: `GWCD4i.DE_stats.by_donors.h5mu`

MuData object containing genome-wide differential expression results computed independently within each pair of donors (using cells from two of the four donors per fit). One modality per donor pair, named by the underscore-joined donor IDs (e.g. `CE0006864_CE0008162`).

Each modality is an AnnData with the same `.obs`, `.var`, and `.layers` schema as `GWCD4i.DE_stats.h5ad` (see "Differential Expression Results" above for column descriptions). The observation key is `{target_contrast}_{culture_condition}`. A target is missing from a given donor-pair modality if it did not pass DE-eligibility filters within the cells from those two donors.
